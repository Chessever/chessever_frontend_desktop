/// A single classification a user can attach to a liked game.
///
/// Tags are the public-facing taxonomy for liked games: later, liked games
/// surface in shared/library views filtered by these tags. The list is a
/// closed vocabulary (fourteen curated tags) so the taxonomy stays browsable
/// and the picker stays legible — a free-text field would fragment the data
/// and make cross-user filtering meaningless.
///
/// [color] is the chip / dropdown-row accent and the dot on the save-sheet
/// chip. The palette is deliberately a *designed set*, not a rainbow: every
/// hue sits in a similar lightness/chroma band so the set reads as one coherent
/// whole, and each hue carries a little of the tag's meaning (gold crown for a
/// mate, venom green for a trap, crimson for a sacrifice, a muddy bronze for a
/// blunder). Labels render in near-white over the tinted fill, which clears
/// 4.5:1 against every colour below.
///
/// Two rules keep the palette honest as the vocabulary grows:
/// * **No two tags share a hex.** Colour is the secondary encoding on library
///   card pills and filter chips, where two tags sit side by side — duplicate
///   accents make them read as the same thing.
/// * **A category shares a hue.** The three game phases are one axis (*which
///   part of the game*), not three unrelated flavours, so they run as a tonal
///   ramp down a single yellow-green rather than grabbing three more hues off
///   an already-full wheel.
///
/// [icon] is a glyph that *explains* the tag at a glance in the post-like
/// dropdown: a cyclone for chaos, a crown for a beautiful mate, a spider for a
/// venom trap, a shield for defence, a rocket for a comeback, and so on.
