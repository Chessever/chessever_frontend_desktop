/// push the total above the cap, the paywall is shown and the future resolves
/// to whether the user subscribed during that sheet.
///
/// [gamesToAdd] is the count being added in this operation (1 for a single
/// save, N for a bulk/import action). The lookup uses the nearest
/// [ProviderScope] so this can be called from places that don't have a
/// `WidgetRef` (e.g. top-level `showXxxSheet` functions).
///
/// The count comes from a **fresh server-side COUNT** rather than the cached
/// realtime stream provider. The stream lags behind a just-completed save by
/// the round-trip time of Supabase realtime, which would let free users
/// squeak in extra games without the paywall firing.
