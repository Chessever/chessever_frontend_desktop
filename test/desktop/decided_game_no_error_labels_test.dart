/// hard near the edges that a decided game runs out of chances to lose all by
/// itself. A player already lost by nine pawns cannot shed another 0.1, and a
/// mate held in either direction is excluded by name rather than by band.

/// when the mover is decisively winning before and after the move, conversion
/// noise receives no negative symbol. For human review, +7 and +4 are both won.
